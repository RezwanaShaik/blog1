    <p align="justify">5G is the fifth generation of wireless cellular technology, offering higher upload and download speeds, more consistent connections, and improved capacity than previous networks.<mark>5G is much faster and more reliable than the currently popular 4G networks</mark> and has the potential to transform the way we use the internet to access applications, social networks, and information. For example, technologies like self-driving cars, advanced gaming applications, and live streaming media that require very reliable, high-speed data connections are set to benefit greatly from 5G connectivity.</p>

        <h2>Evaluation of 5G</h2>
    </left>
        <p align="justify">
            5G revolutionized mobile broadband service by increasing the communications speeds and reducing air interface latency while simultaneously improving reliability. 5G-Advanced, currently standardized in 3GPP, will establish a foundation and direction for 6G by the end of this decade.
            5G technology offers an extremely low latency rate, the delay between the sending and receiving information. From 200 milliseconds for 4G, we go down to 1 millisecond(1 ms) with 5G. Just think about it. A millisecond is 1/1000 of a second.

<h2>How does 5G technology work?</h2>
<p style align="justify">5G technology will introduce advances throughout network architecture. 5G New Radio, the global standard for a more capable 5G wireless air interface, will cover spectrums not used in 4G. New antennas will incorporate technology known as massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple output), which enables multiple transmitters and receivers to transfer more data at the same time. <br>But 5G technology is not limited to the new radio spectrum. It is designed to support a converged, heterogeneous network combining licensed and unlicensed wireless technologies.<br>
    While earlier generations of cellular technology (such as 4G LTE) focused on ensuring connectivity, 5G takes connectivity to the next level by delivering connected experiences from the cloud to clients. 5G networks are virtualized and software-driven, and they exploit cloud technologies.

    <h2>Key Characteristics of 5G</h2>
    <h3>Speed</h3>
    <p style align="justify">5G networks offer speeds up to 10 Gbps, which is up to 100 times faster than 4G LTE. This high-speed capability enables tasks such as high-definition video streaming, real-time gaming, and instant downloads, making it ideal for data-intensive applications.</p>
    <h3>Low Latency</h3>
    <p style align="justify">Latency, or the delay before data begins transferring, is reduced to as low as 1 millisecond in 5G, compared to the 20-30 milliseconds typical in 4G. Low latency is critical for applications that require real-time responsiveness, such as autonomous vehicles, remote surgeries, and immersive augmented reality (AR) experiences.</p>
    <h3>Device Capacity</h3>
    <p style align="justify">5G networks can support up to a million devices per square kilometer, a substantial increase over 4G's capacity. This high capacity is essential for the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, making 5G ideal for supporting smart cities, connected appliances, and industrial IoT.
